    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 31, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Circle Square</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information across all mobile applications (“apps”) published by Circle Square.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Circle Square apps do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, contact details, or advertising identifiers. 
      We do not use cookies or tracking technologies for analytics or ad personalization.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      Some Circle Square apps display ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. 
      This app uses Google AdMob to serve ads. AdMob may automatically collect device identifiers, including the Advertising ID (e.g. AAID), as well as other device information (model, IP address, OS version). This information is used solely for ad‑serving purposes, and the app itself does not collect or store personally identifiable user data.
      To protect all users—including children—we have configured our apps to request <strong>non-personalized ads only</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can learn more about how Google delivers non-personalized ads at
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Google’s Advertising Policy
      </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      All Circle Square apps are designed for general audiences and may be used by children aged 3 and above. 
      Because our apps serve only non-personalized ads and collect no personal information, they fully comply with the 
      <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and the 
      <strong>Google Play Families Policy</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share or sell any user data. 
      Limited, non-personal data required for basic ad delivery (such as general device information) may be processed by Google AdMob in accordance with Google’s own privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to ensure that all third-party services used by our apps maintain secure and compliant data-handling practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised “Effective Date.”
    </p>
